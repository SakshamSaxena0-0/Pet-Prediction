</ul>

### Dataset
<ul dir="auto">

● Organize your dataset in the following structure:

● dataset/training_set/: Contains subfolders cats/ and dogs/ with training images.

● dataset/test_set/: Contains subfolders cats/ and dogs/ with test images.

● You can find datasets for cats and dogs on platforms like Kaggle.
</ul>

## Usage
